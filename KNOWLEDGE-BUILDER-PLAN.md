- Improve robustness of data processing (PDF upload, web browsing, text processing).
- Make the agent framework safer and more observable (tool calls, reasoning traces).
- Add minimal automated tests and basic CI.

## Medium-Term Goals

- Enhance semantic search over the knowledge base.
- Improve visualization capabilities and UX.
- Refactor large frontend views into smaller components (especially the Agents view).
- Introduce basic access control for write operations.

## Long-Term Ideas

- Advanced entity linking and ontology integration.
- Real-time collaboration features.
- Plugin/extensions system for custom tools and agents.
